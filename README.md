## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to classify customers and analyize the value of customers using the RFM method, and to create a dashboard with Tableau for visualization.

## Data Source

The dataset is a competition currently in progress at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data), and there were various files related to customer data, but I just use the `transaction.csv` data for customer analysis.

This dataset consisted of about 1.3 million pieces of data.
